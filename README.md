# Redfield Weather
This is a project I created for my weather data.  This in an AngularJS 1.5 project using a WebAPI backend for data.

In the full solution under the RedfieldWeather project there is a mldn folder that contains PHP.  I do not own this code so I am not includeing it in this project.
